## Introduction
With the announcement of [World Gran Colosseum](https://sinoalice.global/en/news/60e6a2d3), we also got confirmation that Colosseum Sin will be coming to Sinoalice Global. While I imagine more exact details about how it will be implemented on Global will come along with the September Gran Colosseum, the following is a bit of a rundown on how it works on JP, based on the currently available information on their upcoming 9th Colosseum Sin. 

## Qualifying

Guilds qualify for Colosseum Sin through their performance across the two preceding Gran Colosseums. 

Gran Colosseum performance in this case is calculated by way of two metrics: Sin Points and Lifeforce. Sin Points are calculated based on a flat amount given depending on a guild's Gran Colosseum league placement, with 5,000 points awarded for League 1 and none for League 2, as well as a guild's overall placement in Gran Colosseum, according to the following tables:

### League 1 Sin Points

| Placement | Sin Points gained per rank within placement bracket |
|---|---|
| 1-10 | 1,000 Sin Points |
| 11-20 | 500 Sin Points |
| 21-50 | 100 Sin Points |
| 51-100 | 50 Sin Points |
| 101-600 | 10 Sin Points |
| 601-1,000 | 1 Sin Point |

### League 2 Sin Points

| Placement | Sin Points gained per rank within placement bracket |
|---|---|
| 1-10 | 100 Sin Points |
| 11-20 | 50 Sin Points |
| 21-50 | 10 Sin Points |
| 51-100 | 5 Sin Points |
| 101-2,000 | 1 Sin Points |

So for example, if your guild places 100th in League 1, you would get
5,000 (base points) + 400 (1 per place for 601-1,000) + 5,000 (10 per place for 101-600) + 50 (50 per place for 51-100) = 10,450 Sin Points. 

Guilds qualify for Colosseum Sin based first on the number of Sin Points gained during the two Gran Colosseums during the qualifying period.

As each timeslot is given a fixed number of Colosseum Sin timeslots (similar to Gran Colosseum Finals), guilds are competing against other guilds in their timeslot for Colosseum Sin placements. If a guild plays both qualifying period Gran Colosseums in the same timeslot, their Sin Points and Lifeforce gained during the two Gran Colosseums will be added. If a guild plays in different timeslots, only the higher score will be taken into account.

If guilds tie on Sin Points, Lifeforce is used as a tiebreaker. Sin Points are assigned to a guild and not its players, so a guild will lose its Sin Points if it disbands during the qualification period.

## Divisions

Guilds on JP can currently qualify for one of three tournament divisions: Ultimate 32, Super Division, and Normal Division. The number of slots given to each timeslot varies based on a number of factors, such as previous Ultimate 32 performance and Gran Colosseum results. Pokelabo says that roughly speaking, guilds in Division 1 of Gran Colosseum will be placed in Super, while guilds on the higher end of Division 2 will be placed in Normal. I personally would not be surprised if Global gets Super and Normal merged, given the lower population.

Timeslot distribution on JP for 9th Colosseum Sin looks like the following: 

### Ultimate 32 guilds per timeslot
| Timeslot | # of guilds |
|---|---|
| 8:00 | 2 |
| 12:30 | 2 |
| 19:00 | 2 |
| 20:00 | 2 |
| 21:00 | 4 |
| 22:00 | 10 |
| 23:00 | 10 |

### Super Division guilds per timeslot
| Timeslot | # of guilds |
|---|---|
| 8:00 | 32 |
| 12:30 | 32 |
| 19:00 | 32 |
| 20:00 | 64 |
| 21:00 | 256 |
| 22:00 | 576 |
| 23:00 | 416 |

### Normal Division guilds per timeslot
| Timeslot | # of guilds |
|---|---|
| 8:00 | 64 |
| 12:30 | 96 |
| 19:00 | 32 |
| 20:00 | 160 |
| 21:00 | 416 |
| 22:00 | 672 |
| 23:00 | 480 |

All Colosseum Sin tournaments are 32-guild single elimination brackets. Super and Normal Division tournaments take place within their own timeslot, while Ultimate 32 takes place during a number of different timeslots as it consists of guilds from different timeslots. 

As of the 9th Colosseum Sin, bracketing for Ultimate 32 takes into account a guild's placement within its timeslot. Bracketing also tries to avoid early matchups between guilds with high Sin Point rankings. 

There are a few more eligibility rules for guilds who want to qualify for Ultimate 32:
- Guilds cannot have 12 or fewer guild members at the time of maintenance prior to the event page for the main tournament going live.
- Guilds cannot have 5 or more changed members between the end of Gran Colosseum qualifying and the event page for the main tournament going live. 

Times and dates for these cutoffs are given in the rules page. Incidentally, the maintenance prior to the main tournament event page going live is also when guild names and members are noted for official purposes such as social media posts and prize distribution.
