## Introduction
With the announcement of [World Gran Colosseum](https://sinoalice.global/en/news/60e6a2d3), we also got confirmation that Colosseum Sin will be coming to Sinoalice Global. While I imagine more exact details about how it will be implemented on Global will come along with the September Gran Colosseum, the following is a bit of a rundown on how it works on JP, based on the currently available information on their upcoming 9th Colosseum Sin. 

## Qualifying

Guilds qualify for Colosseum Sin through their performance across the two preceding Gran Colosseums. 

Gran Colosseum performance in this case is calculated by way of two metrics: Sin Points and Lifeforce. Sin Points are calculated based on a flat amount given depending on a guild's Gran Colosseum league placement, with 5,000 points awarded for League 1 and none for League 2, as well as a guild's overall placement in Gran Colosseum, according to the following tables:

### League 1 Sin Points

| Placement | Sin Points gained per rank within placement bracket |
|---|---|
| 1-10 | 1,000 Sin Points |
| 11-20 | 500 Sin Points |
| 21-50 | 100 Sin Points |
| 51-100 | 50 Sin Points |
| 101-600 | 10 Sin Points |
| 601-1,000 | 1 Sin Point |

### League 2 Sin Points

| Placement | Sin Points gained per rank within placement bracket |
|---|---|
| 1-10 | 100 Sin Points |
| 11-20 | 50 Sin Points |
| 21-50 | 10 Sin Points |
| 51-100 | 5 Sin Points |
| 101-2,000 | 1 Sin Points |

So for example, if your guild places 100th in League 1, you would get
5,000 (base points) + 400 (1 per place for 601-1,000) + 5,000 (10 per place for 101-600) + 50 (50 per place for 51-100) = 10,450 Sin Points. 



Sin pts within timeslot - play in 2 tses split scores with higher prioritized - lost if guild disbands
Inochi tiebreaker

Sorted into u32/super/normal, slots based on ts

U32 bracketing keeps top guilds from same ts away from each other in early rounds
# of u32 slots based on old u32/gc results from that ts

Lower tournaments are just based on proximity
Super = div1, normal = top div2


Eligibility:
12 or fewer guild members during maint prior to finals event page going up
5+ members changed between end of qualifying and finals event page going up (dates/times for these given)
Incidentally this is also when guild name and members will be noted for official purposes (sns, prizes)
