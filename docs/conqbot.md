# Conquest Info Bot
(Last updated August 12, 2021)

## Overview

The Conquest Info Bot is a Discord bot I pieced together used for quick and dirty reference information about Conquests. This isn't incredibly useful at the moment, but will be in the future if there are more frequent rotations of redux Conquests as there are on JP. 

A list of commands for the bot can be triggered using the command !helpme. 

Commands can roughly be sorted into three types.

First, you can type a ! followed by a nightmare's name (or a shortening of it, such as !basi for Basilisk) to see the suggested Character, Armor, and damage type for that Conquest, a short blurb about how to approach the fight, interesting boss drops (including Hard mode drops that have yet to be implemented), and what Shell weapons require its cores for evolution and skill rerolling (a feature that has yet to be implemented at the time of writing). 

There is also a schedule, triggered by !schedule, that shows any known dates for current/upcoming Conquests.

Finally, you can use the command !shell(Weapon type), such as !shelltome, to see information about a shell weapon including the cores required to evolve it, the cores required to reroll its skills (again, not yet implemented and based off of JP), and desirable reroll skills for Colosseum (see previous caveat).

This bot is currently self-hosted, which means it suffers from some downtime (especially over the summer, when I've been putting my computer to sleep overnight). If more people start using it, I'll either keep my computer running overnight or find actual hosting.
