## Introduction
With the announcement of [World Gran Colosseum](https://sinoalice.global/en/news/60e6a2d3), we also got [confirmation](https://sinoalice.global/en/news/60e3cedf) that Colosseum Sin will be coming to Sinoalice Global. While I imagine more exact details about how it will be implemented on Global will come along with the September Gran Colosseum, the following is a bit of a rundown on how it works on JP, based on the currently available information on their upcoming 9th Colosseum Sin. 

## Qualifying

Guilds qualify for Colosseum Sin tournaments through their performance across the two preceding Gran Colosseums. In the case of 9th Colosseum Sin, this means the 44th Gran Colosseum (July 18-23) and 45th Gran Colosseum (August 15-20) are the qualifiers for the 9th Colosseum Sin tournaments (August 25-September 12). The Gran Colosseum following a Colosseum Sin generally is not a qualifier for the next Colosseum Sin and takes place later in the month (46th Gran Colosseum runs from September 19-24). Gran Colosseum Finals performance is not taken into consideration when determining Colosseum Sin eligibility.

Gran Colosseum performance in this case is calculated by way of two metrics: Sin Points and Lifeforce. Sin Points are calculated based on a flat amount given depending on a guild's Gran Colosseum league placement, with 5,000 points awarded for League 1 and none for League 2, as well as a guild's overall placement in Gran Colosseum, according to the following tables:

### League 1 Sin Points

| Placement | Sin Points gained per rank within placement bracket |
|---|---|
| 1-10 | 1,000 Sin Points |
| 11-20 | 500 Sin Points |
| 21-50 | 100 Sin Points |
| 51-100 | 50 Sin Points |
| 101-600 | 10 Sin Points |
| 601-1,000 | 1 Sin Point |

### League 2 Sin Points

| Placement | Sin Points gained per rank within placement bracket |
|---|---|
| 1-10 | 100 Sin Points |
| 11-20 | 50 Sin Points |
| 21-50 | 10 Sin Points |
| 51-100 | 5 Sin Points |
| 101-2,000 | 1 Sin Points |

So for example, if your guild places 100th in League 1, you would get
5,000 (base points) + 400 (1 per place for 601-1,000) + 5,000 (10 per place for 101-600) + 50 (50 per place for 51-100) = 10,450 Sin Points. 

Guilds qualify for Colosseum Sin based first on the number of Sin Points gained during the two Gran Colosseums during the qualifying period. If guilds tie on Sin Points, Lifeforce is used as a tiebreaker. Sin Points are assigned to a guild and not its players, so a guild will lose its Sin Points if it disbands during the qualification period.

As each timeslot is given a fixed number of Colosseum Sin timeslots (similar to Gran Colosseum Finals), guilds are competing against other guilds in their timeslot for Colosseum Sin placements. If a guild plays both qualifying period Gran Colosseums in the same timeslot, their Sin Points and Lifeforce gained during the two Gran Colosseums will be combined. If a guild plays in different timeslots, only the higher score will be taken into account.

## Divisions

Guilds on JP can currently qualify for one of three tournament divisions: Ultimate 32, Super Division, and Normal Division. The number of slots given to each timeslot varies based on a number of factors, such as previous Ultimate 32 performance and Gran Colosseum results. Pokelabo says that roughly speaking, guilds in Division 1 of Gran Colosseum will be placed in Super, while guilds on the higher end of Division 2 will be placed in Normal. I personally would not be surprised if Global gets Super and Normal merged, given the lower population.

Timeslot distribution on JP for 9th Colosseum Sin looks like the following: 

### Ultimate 32 guilds per timeslot

| Timeslot | # of guilds |
|---|---|
| 8:00 | 2 |
| 12:30 | 2 |
| 19:00 | 2 |
| 20:00 | 2 |
| 21:00 | 4 |
| 22:00 | 10 |
| 23:00 | 10 |

### Super Division guilds per timeslot

| Timeslot | # of guilds |
|---|---|
| 8:00 | 32 |
| 12:30 | 32 |
| 19:00 | 32 |
| 20:00 | 64 |
| 21:00 | 256 |
| 22:00 | 576 |
| 23:00 | 416 |

### Normal Division guilds per timeslot

| Timeslot | # of guilds |
|---|---|
| 8:00 | 64 |
| 12:30 | 96 |
| 19:00 | 32 |
| 20:00 | 160 |
| 21:00 | 416 |
| 22:00 | 672 |
| 23:00 | 480 |

All Colosseum Sin tournaments are 32-guild single elimination brackets. Super and Normal Division tournaments take place within their own timeslot, while Ultimate 32 takes place across a number of different timeslots as it consists of guilds from different timeslots. 

As of the 9th Colosseum Sin, bracketing for Ultimate 32 takes into account a guild's placement within its timeslot. Bracketing also tries to avoid early matchups between guilds with high Sin Point rankings. 

There are a few more eligibility rules for guilds who want to qualify for Ultimate 32:
- Guilds cannot have 12 or fewer guild members at the time of maintenance prior to the event page for the main tournament going live.
- Guilds cannot have 5 or more changed members between the end of Gran Colosseum qualifying and the event page for the main tournament going live. 

Specific times and dates for these cutoffs are given in the rules page. Incidentally, the maintenance prior to the main tournament event page going live is also when guild names and members are recorded for official purposes such as social media posts and prize distribution.

## Scheduling

As noted above, Super and Normal Division tournaments take place within their own timeslot, while Ultimate 32 takes place across a number of different timeslots as it consists of guilds from different timeslots. For the 9th Colosseum Sin, that breakdown looks like the following:

### Ultimate 32 Round Times

| Round | Time (JST) |
|---|---|
| Round of 32 | Aug. 29 (Sun) 19:00 |
| Round of 16 | Sep. 1 (Wed) 21:00 |
| Round of 8 | Sep. 5 (Sun) 20:00 |
| Semifinals | Sep. 8 (Wed) 23:00 |
| Finals | Sep. 12 (Sun) 22:00 |

These dates (matches on Sundays and Wednesdays) and times per round seem to be the standard for all Colosseum Sins (Colosseums Sin?), but I haven't been able to check every single one.

Dates are also established to replay Ultimate 32 rounds in the case of technical errors preventing Colosseum from taking place properly:

### Ultimate 32 Rematch Round Times

| Round | Time (JST) |
|---|---|
| Round of 32 | Aug. 31 (Tue) 19:00 |
| Round of 16 | Sep. 3 (Fri) 21:00 |
| Round of 8 | Sep. 7 (Tue) 20:00 |
| Semifinals | Sep. 10 (Fri) 23:00 |
| Finals | Sep. 14 (Tue) 22:00 |

For Super and Normal division, the above dates are used but the match will be played during the affected timeslot's normal time.

## Sin Colosseum Tournament Matches

Sin Colosseum tournament matches are single-elimination and decided by the win/loss result of the Colosseum match played. In the case of a tie, the guild with the higher Sin Point total coming into the match will win. 

Demons summoned during Colosseum Sin tournament matches may not be the same as those summoned during that day's regular Colosseum.

Guilds will still have regular Colosseum at their normal timeslot during the tournament period on non-tournament days.

**During the tournament period, guilds cannot disband or change (add or remove) members.** This restriction is unlocked at midnight on the second day after your guild exits the tournament. (If your guild loses at 22:00 on the 7th, restrictions will be unlocked at midnight on the 9th.)

## Rewards

Rewards are given after the end of Colosseum Sin to all members of a guild as recorded during the maintenance before the tournaments for that Colosseum Sin begin. This means that even if your guild loses early in the tournament, you can change guilds and still receive rewards for the guild you played in after Colosseum Sin ends.

Rewards for Colosseum Sin are given according to Division and placement. Ultimate 32 and Super Division guilds receive a Guild Ship lamp part indicating what Division they played in, as well as placement for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd/4th in Ultimate 32. Ultimate 32 guilds also receive participation rewards, such as a character skin, a special icon next to your name in battle, a special effect/aura around your character (for top 16 guilds), a special stamp, and an [improved Colosseum reward calendar](https://twitter.com/DELLNoALICE/status/1399717989931356164) (Colosseum Monthly Participation Bonus) that is generally equivalent to doubled regular rewards and sometimes a character skin. 

The special icon, effect, and stamp are usable until the following Colosseum Sin tournament, and the icon/effect can be turned on by equipping the title given to you for your performance at that Colosseum Sin. The improved monthly bonus begins the month following your Colosseum Sin result and lasts for two months.
